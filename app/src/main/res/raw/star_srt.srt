00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:10,904

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,399
What cha gonna do, when
your time is up

3
00:00:14,507 --> 00:00:18,006
What cha gonna say, when

4
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:20,751
What cha wanna do, when
you're on your own

5
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:27,108
There's a road, long and winding

6
00:00:27,714 --> 00:00:34,113
The lights are blindin',
but it gets there

7
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:40,610
Don't give up, don't look back

8
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:48,317
There's a silver linin', it's
out there somewhere

9
00:00:49,903 --> 00:00:56,802
Everybody wants an answer,
everybody needs a friend

10
00:00:56,918 --> 00:01:03,017
We all need a shinin' star
on which we can depend

11
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:07,900
N' so tonight we're gonna
wish upon a star

12
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:17,301
We never wished upon before (to
find what you're looking for)

13
00:01:17,419 --> 00:01:24,318
There'll be times, in your life

14
00:01:24,412 --> 00:01:30,911
Ya when you' be dancin' n' shit,
but you ain't gettin it

15
00:01:31,403 --> 00:01:37,602
But don't get disillusioned,
no, don't expect too much

16
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:42,907
'Cause if what you have is all
you can get just keep on

17
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:45,798
Tryin', it just ain't happened yet

18
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:53,207
Everybody wants to be winner,
everybody has a dream

19
00:01:53,307 --> 00:01:59,806
We all need a shinin' star when
things ain't what they seem

20
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,399
So tonight we're gonna
wish upon a star

21
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:15,916
We never wished upon before (gotta
get where you're headed for)

22
00:02:28,806 --> 00:02:34,805
Everybody wants some kindness,
everybody needs a break

23
00:02:35,815 --> 00:02:41,914
We all need a shinin' star when
things get hard to take

24
00:02:42,302 --> 00:02:46,701
So tonight we're gonna
wish upon a star

25
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:52,014
We never wished upon before

26
00:02:53,014 --> 00:02:57,313
So tonight we're gonna
wish upon a star

27
00:02:57,417 --> 00:03:01,616
We never wished upon before

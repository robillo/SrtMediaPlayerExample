1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,500
mark Manson the subtle art of not giving

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,410
a fuck a counterintuitive approach to

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,429
living a good life we live in an era of

4
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,980
opportunity whether we want to choose a

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,289
career a partner or a favorite news

6
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,270
source we have a multitude of options

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,480
available to us so why isn't it pure

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,090
bliss to be alive why are so many of a

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,910
stressed and unfulfilled we should have

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,060
everything we want we're so stressed out

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,460
because we're trying to do it all we

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,620
have so many options open to us we end

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,059
up concentrating on all our different

14
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,360
choices and opportunities all the time

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,879
so what can we do instead we need to

16
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,469
find out what is important to us and

17
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,260
concentrate on doing that everything

18
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,690
else well we shouldn't give a fuck about

19
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,809
it by limiting what we do we will be

20
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:00,000
happier and better people
